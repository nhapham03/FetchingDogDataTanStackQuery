# FetchingDogDataTanStackQuery
 This is a project using React Native Expo and TanStack Query to fetch information from an open source API. 
 I am showing different dogs information, such as breeds, names, facts, etc.
 I am also displaying messages, like error, loading, pending, success messages.
 I run my app by using the command "npx expo start"
